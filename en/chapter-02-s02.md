# Atom + clickable

## The new development environment

**The new environment changes ONLY the tools used for application development; ALL the concepts exposed in the previous chapters (QML, JavaScript...) are valid again !**
Also the source code don’t need modifications to be compliant with the new environment.

In the previous chapters of this course we have used Ubuntu SDK-IDE as "official" development tool.

Now the situation is changed: **UBports community decide to deprecate that SDK-IDE and his related tools** like phone emulator (more info at: [Clickable for Atom](https://ubports.com/blog/ubports-blog-1/post/clickable-for-atom-98)).
The UBports community environment will be exposed in this section.

If you don’t want leave **Ubuntu SDK-IDE**, an unofficial alternative, is use the Virtual Machine based on 16.04 with Ubuntu sdk-ide provided with this course. You can download it from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9PnbdpLgp86LWNYQ0JOcnNiTVE/view)


The **UBports** development environment is composed of three parts:

1. [Atom editor](https://atom.io/)
2. [Clickable](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/ ) as tool to build, compile an run applications.
3. [atom-build-clickable](https://atom.io/packages/atom-build-clickable) an Atom plugin to use Clickable from Atom

For deeper informations about them, please, see their web site: we’ll present only the necessary informations.

## Clickable

**Clickable** is a command line tool to build, run and deploy Ubuntu Touch (UBports) applications. Currently the last stable version is the 5.0.0. To install it or get the official documentation [visit this link](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/install.html).
We don’t report here the installation steps because are already well explained on the web site.

**Note:** If you have a Nvidia graphic card, we suggest to use the open source Nvidia driver (named "Nouveau") not the closed source version, currently could be little issues using the new development environment's "desktop mode".

All **Clickable** features are available with the executable named "clickable" (is not necessary be root to use it).

At configuration level introduces a new file descriptor named "**clickable.json**" to be placed in the root source folder of the application (the one with "manifest.json" and ".pro" files). See: [clickable.json Format](http://clickable.bhdouglass.com/en/latest/clickable-json.html for details).

That file descriptor is created when a **NEW clickable project** is created using the command "**clickable create**" (or "**clickable init**" for previous clickable versions).
In case of this file is missing (for example  application made  with Ubuntu-sdk-ide) we will show later how to create it.

## Atom

**Atom:** is an open source editor that can be extended with many plugins.
UBports community has developed a new plugin to add new features related at Ubuntu Touch application development.

Atom can be installed with “Ubuntu Software Center” or downloading the package from [Atom Web Site](https://atom.io/ )

If you choose the second installation method, to install it use this command (for Debian like distro):
```bash
sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
```

After a successful installation is necessary proceed with the installation of UBports plugin named [atom-build-clickable](https://atom.io/packages/atom-build-clickable )
Here we refer at the last available version, the 0.3.0

Search it from **Atom** menu: "Edit" → "Preferences" → "install". During the installation, if **Atom** ask you to install other plugins required by Clickable one, accept.

Current version of the plugin, allow to build and run applications without the use of command line (ie  use "clickable" command). NOTE: the plugin is currently under development and some features could be missing.

We suggest also to install the plugin "language-qml" (NOT developed by **UBports** community) to have a basic syntax highlight for QML files. Also a Javascript plugin available for Atom, can be useful.

**IMPORTANT**: "**atom-build-clickable**" plugin is active only when the opened folder/project contains the file descriptor "**clickable.json**" used by Clickable tool.
When active, you can see a "Clickable" menu entry in **Atom** menu bar and a new one in the bottom left part (next image).
